With this script,

You have to give the folder location
then you have to type the filetype(extension) which you want to count
Then it show you the file counts in a popup window
I usually use this script, to count the frame numbers for the shots to add in excel sheet. but there is an external module called Pysequence which is specially designed for these kind of stuffs.
